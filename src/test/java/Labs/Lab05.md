## Explain your Cucumber BDD Framework Structure
Record yourself through your webcam and screen explaining our Cucumber BDD project framework structure
This will act as a mock interview and test your ability to communicate about Selenium based testing frameworks
- maximum 5 minutes in length 
- minimum of 2.5 minutes long

### Avoid over-explaining and try to cover the basic outline of your:
1) APIs (dependencies) used
2) each packages and their overall purpose in your project
3) try to touch on your project base classes such as your utilities and the Hooks class for step definitions
4) cover the usage of your tag name groupings for the TestRunner

Finally, understand that your target audience (Technical recruiter or HR managers) will have a very basic understanding of this
technology, but will still have some understanding. Ceratain OOP buzzwords (like encapsulation or continuous integration) will 
definitely tick boxes on their interview sheet.

You are free to send your video to course staff for evaluation if completed on time.

Aside from this lab general tip: be prepared to answer some short general purpose questions about Java. It may something random
and hard to remember on the spot such as "Can I overload methods in different classes?"
